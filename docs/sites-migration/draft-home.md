We are entering the final stages of CLDR 23 data development, which is just
focusing on four locales for data submission: Armenian (hy), Georgian (ka),
Mongolian (mn), Welsh (cy)

You have until Jan 23 for adding new strings, and until Jan 31 for corrections.
Please review and follow the instructions on [Priority
Items](translation/getting-started/vetting-view/index.md) to complete your work,
and resolve any remaining errors or disputes.
