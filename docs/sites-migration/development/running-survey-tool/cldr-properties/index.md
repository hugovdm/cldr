setup](../setup.md) page as a starting point.

This configuration file, located inside the 'cldr' directory of your web server,
has a number of settings. This list aims to be a comprehensive guide to this
file.

Some parameters may be edited within the SurveyTool by using the [Step-by-step
setup](../setup.md). Just open tomcat/cldr/admin.html and click on the Setup
link to get started.

Here is a description of the Priority column:

*   **MANDATORY**: This option must be set correctly. Please check it. ST will
    not function properly if not set.
*   **Optional**: May be set, if needed.
*   **Production**: This should be set for production use, but is not necessary
    for development use.
*   **Debug**: Should only be set for testing purposes.
*   (**deprecated**): Do not set this option.
