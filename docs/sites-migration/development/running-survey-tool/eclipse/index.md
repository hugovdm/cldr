# Building and Running the Survey Tool on Eclipse

How to build and run the Survey Tool under Eclipse.

These instructions are under construction. Add comments below with any feedback
or questions.

These instructions assume you are checking out/building the trunk CLDR and
tools.

### Set up CLDR for Eclipse

*   See: [Eclipse Setup](../../eclipse-setup/index.md). Make sure you have
    "Eclipse for Java EE".
    Include the "cldr-apps" project when you import projects. It will import as
    a "Java EE" project.

### Initial Prerequisites

\[MD: added yellow here and below with recent notes as I updated.\]

#### Tomcat

Open tools/cldr-apps/.classpath and search for "Tomcat" to find out the version
you need, which we'll call XX in this description.

The SurveyTool is tested and deployed on Tomcat XX .

Download and unpack the latest Core distribution of Tomcat somewhere (use
directories without spaces in their name), but don't attempt to install or run
it- Eclipse will be launching it directly.

*   http://tomcat.apache.org/download-XX.cgi
*   =>
*   <myDirectory>apache-tomcat-XX

Next, bring up the **Server->Runtime Environments** preference section.. Add
your Tomcat runtime, and you can check "Create a New Local Server" now.

*Preferences > Server > Runtime Environments > Apache Tomcat XX >
<myDirectory>apache-tomcat-XX*

\[*Note that you will choose **Apache Tomcat vXX**, otherwise the picture below
is correct.\]*

Next set Server runtime:

*Preferences > Web Services > Server and Runtime > Tomcat XX Server.*

Do a clean build:

### *Project > Clean > Clean All Projects*

*Select org.unicode.cldr.unittest.web.TestAll*

*Run as > Java Application*

*it will fail*

*Run Configurations > TestAll*

*> Arguments > VM Arguments > -DCLDR_ENVIRONMENT=UNITTEST*

*> Main > Rename to TestAll cldr-apps*

*Run TestAll again.*

*you will get lots of System.err messages, but test should pass.*

### Building

At this point, the cldr-apps project should build successfully, without errors.

--> Congratulations. Now, proceed to [SurveyTool Step-by-step
setup](../setup.md).

---

Running cldr-apps any other time

*   Select the cldr-apps project and choose **Run** from the **Run** menu. (Or
    Debug if you want to.)
*   Double-click on Run on Server.

## Troubleshooting

### Unsupported Platforms

#### RAD 7.5

*   On RAD 7.5 I had to add the .jar files, explicitly, to the "Java EE Module
    Dependencies" page before the server would work.

#### WebSphere (instead of Tomcat)

*   On WAS7 there was a conflict between the ICU embedded in WAS7 (3.4.5?) and
    the latest one to be used. A missing symbol UnicodeSet.Freezable identifies
    this problem. Still unresolved.
