# CLDR Development Site

Some of the key pages for developers are:

1.  [New CLDR Developers](new-cldr-developers/index.md)
2.  [Eclipse Setup](eclipse-setup/index.md)
3.  [Eclipse](running-survey-tool/eclipse/index.md) (survey tool)
4.  [Handling Tickets (bugs/enhancements)](development-process_index.md)
5.  [Updating DTDs](updating-dtds/index.md)
6.  [Editing CLDR Spec](editing-cldr-spec/index.md)
7.  [CLDR: Big Red Switch](cldr-big-red-switch/index.md) (checklist for release)
8.  [Adding a new locale to CLDR](adding-locales.md)

The subpages listed give more information on internal CLDR development. See
also: [Sitemap](../system/app/pages/sitemap/hierarchy).

Note: when editing Sites pages it is often useful to clean up HTML in material
pasted in from other sources, such as Word or Google Docs. Some useful regexes
for that:

<(font|span|div)\[^>\]+> <$1>

style="\[^"\]\*"
