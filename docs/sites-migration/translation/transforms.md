# Transforms

Transforms describe ways of converting text. Most often these are
transliterations, converting one script to another, such as:

Source Transliteration キャンパス kyanpasu Αλφαβητικός Κατάλογος Alphabētikós
Katálogos биологический biologicheskij

For those, the name of the language or script is used.

There are a few others that have special purposes, listed below. Note that
whatever translation is used, it should be short (a few words at most).

For the specialized acronyms (marked with \*):

*   If your language uses Latin letters, you probably want to leave this alone
    unless there is a well-known name in your language.
*   For non-Latin, you should transcribe this into your alphabet, and if the
    name is not commonly understood, add the English in parentheses, such as
    "XXX (BGN)" or "XXX (UNGEGN)".
