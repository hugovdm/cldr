# Empty Cache

### Empty Cache

Sometimes you need to flush your browser's cache when the Survey Tool updates.

See

for examples.

In case JavaScript is the issue, you may have to try the following:

**How do I stop JavaScript caching in Chrome?**

Open Google Chrome and navigate to the page you want to test.

Press **F12** (if available) or open **Developer Tools** from within Chrome's
settings (**Settings > More tools > Developer tools**).

Click the cog in the top right of the pop-out box. Check the "**Disable Cache
(while DevTools is open)**" setting box.

Then right-click the "Refresh" button (arrow going in a circle), and pick the
last option (hard reload/empty cache).
