# Number Symbols

The following symbols are used in formatting numbers. They will be substituted
for the placeholders in [Number Patterns](../number-patterns.md).

For English regional locales where English is not the customary language (such
as en_DE, ie, English as used in Germany), the number formats and date formats
should follow what is used for English in that country, which tends to follow
the British or American usage rather than the predominant language (eg, German).
Consult with the English versions of prominent magazines or newspapers for
guidance on usage.

Meaning decimal 2,345.67
decimal separator group 2,345.67
grouping separator, typically for thousands plusSign +23 \*

the plus sign used with numbers

minusSign -23 \* the minus sign used with numbers
The + and - symbols are intended for unary usage, and not for binary usage; thus
represents either the positive number or a negative number. For example, in an
operation 3 -(-2), the defined symbol would be used for the second minus sign,
but not for the subtraction operator. Any directionality markers needed (e.g.
<LRM>) to keep with the number should be included. percentSign 23.4% \* the
percent sign (out of 100) perMille 234‰ \* the
[permille](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Per_mil) sign (out of 1000) exponential
1.2E3 \* used in computers for 1.2×10³. superscriptingExponent1.2×103 \*
human-readable format of exponential infinity ∞ \* used in +∞ and -∞. nan NaN \*
"not a number".
timeSeparator2:33 PM This symbol is currently **==*not used*==** for anything
(and is only visible in SurveyTool at comprehensive level) but may be retrieved
by CLDR data consumers. It should match the time separator symbol actually used
in [Date/Time Patterns](../../date-time-1/date-time-patterns/index.md).

\* – Doesn't typically need to be changed in translation.

**Important**: Review the examples on the right-side pane to ensure that all
pattern and symbols are as expected.
