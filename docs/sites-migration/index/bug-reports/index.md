# CLDR Change Requests

## Requesting Changes

There are two ways to request changes (for bug fixes or new features):

[TOC]

### Use the CLDR Survey Tool

*   **fixing/adding most language-specific data**
*   ***for more information (including opening an account), see **[Survey
    Tool](../survey-tool/index.md).*****

### [File a Ticket](index.md)

*   additions of new locales (see [Adding New Locales](index.md))
*   defects in the survey tool
*   adding or changing non-language data (such as currency usage)
*   additions or changes to data that is not yet handled by the survey tool
    (collation, segmentation, and transliteration)
*   feature requests in CLDR or [UTS #35: Locale Data Markup Language
    (LDML)](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/).

## Filing a Ticket

The CLDR tickets are located at:
<https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/projects/CLDR/>.

To file a ticket, click the red "Create" button in the upper screen area.

If you don't have an account, you'll see an image like the following.

If you see that dialog, please sign up for [a Jira
account](https://id.atlassian.com/signup?continue=https%3A%2F%2Funicode-org.atlassian.net%2Flogin%3FredirectCount%3D1%26dest-url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Funicode-org.atlassian.net%252Fprojects%252FCLDR%252Fissues&application=jira).

In CLDR Bug Reports, please try to give as much information as possible to help
address the issue, and please group related bugs (such as a list of problems
with the LDML specification) into a single bug report.

A few areas are particularly tricky.

*   For the sort order of a language, see [Collation
    Guidelines](../cldr-spec/collation-guidelines.md)
*   For plural rules (ordinals and cardinals), see [Plural
    Rules](../cldr-spec/plural-rules.md)

## Adding New Locales

If you would like to add data for a *new* locale, please follow the instructions
above to **file a ticket, requesting the addition**. You should also notify your
CLDR contact (see [Survey Tool Accounts](../survey-tool/accounts.md)).

*   Make sure that you pick the right locale code for the new data. See [Picking
    the Right Language Code](../cldr-spec/picking-the-right-language-code.md)
*   A new locale is only added if someone commits to supplying [Core Data for
    New Locales](../cldr-spec/minimaldata/index.md).
*   In special cases, XML files in LDML format can be supplied. See [Bulk Data
    Upload](../survey-tool/upload/index.md).
