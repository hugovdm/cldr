## Overview

[TOC]

Unicode CLDR 34 provides an update to the key building blocks for software
supporting the world's languages. CLDR data is used by all [major software
systems](http://cldr.unicode.org/index#TOC-Who-uses-CLDR-) for their software
internationalization and localization, adapting software to the conventions of
different languages for such common software tasks.

CLDR 34 included a [full Survey Tool data collection
phase](https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/34/supplemental/locale_coverage.html),
adding approximately 6M of data overall, resulting in the following language
support:

**Count** **Support Target** 85 full UI and document content 4 general-purpose
document content
üÜï: [Somali](https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/34/delta/so.html) (so),
[Javanese](https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/34/delta/jv.html) (jv) 18 basic
application requirements
üÜï: [Tongan](https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/34/delta/to.html) (to),

[Xhosa](https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/34/delta/xh.html) (xh) ~100languages
with >500 data fields, but that don't satisfy the level definitions

üÜï is for languages reaching the level in this release. Tongan (to), Konkani
(kok), Dzongkha (dz), Tatar (tt) were already in ICU, while Sindhi (sd), Maori
(mi), Turkmen (tk), Javanese (jv), Interlingua (ia), Kurdish (ku), Xhosa (xh)
are being included for the first time in the upcoming [ICU
63](http://site.icu-project.org/download/63). The above counts are just for the
languages (with multiple entries for multi-script languages such as Serbian or
Chinese) ‚Äî there are many additional regional locales.

Other notable changes include:

## Detailed Specification Changes

For detailed specification changes, see [LDML34
Modifications](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-53/tr35.html#Modifications).

## Detailed Structure Changes

*   Calendar
    *   For supplemental calendar <era> elements, a new attribute ‚Äúnamed‚Äù
        indicates whether the era has been assigned a name (part of preparation
        for Japan era transition). If false, the era will not be used in
        formatting. \[#[10750](https://unicode.org/cldr/trac/ticket/10750)\]
*   Units
    *   Added <displayName> as a subelement for <coordinateUnit>, to provide a
        name such as ‚Äúcardinal direction‚Äù for any of the <coordinateUnitPattern
        > elements. \[#[9986](https://unicode.org/cldr/trac/ticket/9986)\]
*   Patterns
    *   Added short patterns for "at most" and "approximately" (the latter for
        use in smart number ranges)
        \[[#11046](https://unicode.org/cldr/trac/ticket/11046)\] (and data for
        main languages)
*   Misc
    *   Deprecated territoryCodes@internet
        \[[#11072](https://unicode.org/cldr/trac/ticket/11072)\]
    *   The telephone number data (telephoneCodeData.xml) has been deprecated
        and removed from CLDR.
        \[#[10383](http://unicode.org/cldr/trac/ticket/10383)\]

## Detailed Data Changes

*   Data additions and updates from Survey Tool data submission and vetting. For
    details see the [detailed delta
    charts](http://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/34/delta/index.html).

In addition, the following changes were made. This is not complete: for a full
list see the [list of bug
fixes](http://unicode.org/cldr/trac/query?resolution=fixed&milestone=34&group=component&max=999).

*   Calendar
    *   In supplemental calendar data for Japanese calendar, added era 236
        starting 2019-05-01 with attribute named="false"; in ‚Äúroot‚Äù and ‚Äúja‚Äù
        locales, added placeholder era names for era 236 (part of preparation
        for Japan era transition).
        \[#[10750](https://unicode.org/cldr/trac/ticket/10750)\]
    *   In supplemental calendar data for Japanese calendar, fixed invalid date
        values for some historic Japanese-calendar eras.
        \[#[11399](https://unicode.org/cldr/trac/ticket/11399)\]
    *   Changed the firstDay (first day of week for calendar display)...
        *   from Monday to Sunday for PT Portugal.
            \[#[10716](https://unicode.org/cldr/trac/ticket/10716)\]
        *   from Sunday to Monday for IE Ireland
            \[#[11192](https://unicode.org/cldr/trac/ticket/11192)\]
        *   from Saturday to Monday for MA Morocco.
            \[#[11052](https://unicode.org/cldr/trac/ticket/11052)\]
        *   from Sunday to Monday for TN Tunisia..
            \[#[11052](https://unicode.org/cldr/trac/ticket/11052)\]
    *   Changed weekend from fri-sat to sat-sun for MA Morocco, TN Tunisia.
        \[#[11052](https://unicode.org/cldr/trac/ticket/11052)\]
*   Date formatting
    *   Added intervalFormats for skeletons with era to gregorian and generic
        calendars for ‚Äúroot‚Äù, ‚Äúen‚Äù, and ‚Äúja‚Äù locales (part of preparation for
        Japan era transition).
        \[#[11327](https://unicode.org/cldr/trac/ticket/11327)\]
    *   In Finnish, changed date formats to use either full or numeric months
        names, avoiding the abbreviated names (which are still available as
        symbols). \[#[10870](https://unicode.org/cldr/trac/ticket/10870)\]
    *   In Korean, fixed a problem in which many formatted dates in certain
        calendars (buddhist, japanese, minguo) displayed a doubled character for
        month ‚ÄúÏõîÏõî‚Äù. \[#[11347](https://unicode.org/cldr/trac/ticket/11347)\]
*   Currency codes and symbols
    *   Added ‚Äú¬§‚Äù as the symbol for unknown currency XXX. This used to be done
        by ICU in code, but it makes more sense to have the data in CLDR.
        \[#[11074](https://unicode.org/cldr/trac/ticket/11074)\]
    *   In Thai locale, changed the symbol for THB from ‚ÄúTHB‚Äù back to ‚Äú‡∏ø‚Äù.

*   Units
    *   Added units for concentr-percent (e.g. ‚Äú25%)‚Äù and concentr-permille
        (e.g. ‚Äú37‚Ä∞‚Äù). The former may be able to replace some usages of the
        <percentFormats> in <numbers>; it provides different display widths and
        plural forms, through it does not include a number format and cannot
        vary by number system.
        \[#[10632](https://unicode.org/cldr/trac/ticket/10632)\]
    *   Added units for pressure-atmosphere (e.g. ‚Äú1 atm‚Äù) and digital-petabyte
        (e.g. ‚Äú10 PB‚Äù). \[#[10600](https://unicode.org/cldr/trac/ticket/10600),
        #[14075](https://unicode.org/cldr/trac/changeset/14075)\]
*   Plural rules
    *   Rules added for (cardinals) ia, sc ; (ordinals) gd, ia, sc
*   Emoji
    *   Reviewed and revised emoji names and keywords for most languages
        *   The survey tool voting process was adapted to support sets more
            naturally
    *   Updated the emoji ordering to group characters more naturally
        \[[#11227](https://unicode.org/cldr/trac/ticket/11227)\], ...
    *   Revised the derived name generation (for complex emoji) for more
        consistency with the new hair styles
*   Data Cleanup
    *   Modified the input processor for Kyrgyz
        \[[#10738](https://unicode.org/cldr/trac/ticket/10738)\] and Urdu
        \[[#10543](https://unicode.org/cldr/trac/ticket/10543)\]
    *   Improved the Zawgji detection/conversion for input to Survey Tool
    *   Fixed Dutch dayPeriod names to use correct apostrophes.
*   Misc
    *   Added fallbacks for "or" lists
        \[[#11254](https://unicode.org/cldr/trac/ticket/11254)\]
    *   Added English names for Pseudolocales
        \[[#10880](https://unicode.org/cldr/trac/ticket/10880)\]
    *   Cleaned up root parseLenient data
        \[[#11055](https://unicode.org/cldr/trac/ticket/11055)\]

    *   Added data for England, Scotland, Wales (now done with Survey Tool
        \[[#10252](https://unicode.org/cldr/trac/ticket/10252)\])
    *   The French locale now uses narrow no-break space U+202F is several
        places: as the numeric grouping separator, in many short unit patterns,
        and in the locale display name patterns. It also changed normal space to
        no-break space U+00A0 in the wide unit patterns.

## Growth

The following summarizes the number of changes (additions + corrections) for
languages in the release.

**Lang.** **Changes** **Examples** 12 2,000‚Äì5,000
[Pashto](https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/34/delta/ps.html),

The following shows languages with a larger relative number of changes. For the
first line, there are over 20% additions alone, not counting corrections.

**Lang.** **Changes** **Examples** 4 ‚â• 20% Pashto, Maori, Uzbek (Arabic), and
Punjabi (Arabic) 5 ‚â• 50% Interlingua, Fulah (Adlam), Somali, Javanese, and Maori

TBD: add chart

## Migration

*   French grouping separator changed from no-break space U+00A0 to narrow
    no-break space U+202F.
*   The telephone number data (telephoneCodeData.xml) has been deprecated and
    removed from CLDR. \[#[10383](http://unicode.org/cldr/trac/ticket/10383)\]
*   Locale codes has been changed for Ff (Fular) locales to include the script
    tag Latn in anticipation of expected Adlam support in the upcoming release.
    (e.g. ff_CM has been renamed to ff_Latn_CM).

## Known Issues

(These may addressed in a maintenance update)

*   For en_AU, the timeSeparator symbol has '.', while the actual time formats
    use ':'. \[#[11462](https://unicode.org/cldr/trac/ticket/11462)\]
*   In several locales (en, kl, ksh) the symbol for NaN is ‚Äú¬§¬§¬§‚Äù which in
    incorrect in that it uses number format pattern characters, and thus causes
    problems for currency parsing.
    \[#[11492](https://unicode.org/cldr/trac/ticket/11492)\]
*   For pt_PT, the compact decimal currency formats have the curency symbol at
    the beginning, which is inconsistent with standards currency patterns.
    \[#[11295](https://unicode.org/cldr/trac/ticket/11295)\]
