## Overview

[TOC]

Unicode CLDR provides an update to the key building blocks for software
supporting the world's languages. CLDR data is used by all [major software
systems](http://cldr.unicode.org/index#TOC-Who-uses-CLDR-) (including all mobile
phones) for their software internationalization and localization, adapting
software to the conventions of different languages.

## Growth

The following chart shows the growth of CLDR locale-specific data over time. It
does not include the non-locale specific data, nor locale-specific data that is
not collected via the Survey Tool. It is thus restricted to data items in
**/main** and **/annotations** directories. The % values are percent of the
*current* measure of Modern coverage. (That level is notched up each release.)

TBD

See also the [Locale Coverage
Data](https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/37/supplemental/locale_coverage.html).

## Migration

## Known Issues
