# Key

*   The Release Note contains a general description of the contents of the
    release, and any relevant notes about the release.
*   The Data link points to a set of zip files containing the contents of the
    release (the files are complete in themselves, and do not require files from
    earlier releases -- for the structure of the zip file, see [Repository
    Organization](http://cldr.unicode.org/index/downloads#Repository_Organization)).
*   The Spec is the version of [UTS #35:
    LDML](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/) that corresponds to the release.
*   The Delta document points to a list of all the bug fixes and features in the
    release, which be used to get the precise corresponding file changes using
    [BugDiffs](http://unicode.org/cgi-bin/bugdiffs.pl).)
*   The SVN Tag can be used to get the files via [Repository
    Access](http://cldr.unicode.org/index/downloads#latest_draft_version).
