Unicode CLDR 21.0.2 is an update release, with no new translations. It contains
only additional BCP47 data for the T extensions approved by the committee (see
[New BCP47 Extension T
Fields](../../development/development-process/design-proposals/t-extension-fields.md))
and a deprecation of one U extension: "direct" collation.

These new T Extension fields and subfields \[[RFC
6497](http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6497.txt)\] are now available for use in
[BCP47](http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47) and [Unicode Locale/Language
Identifiers](http://unicode.org/reports/tr35/#Unicode_Language_and_Locale_Identifiers).
The CLDR committee approved new fields of the T extension for different domains,
allowing users of the T extensions to ignore types of subfields that are not
relevant to them, and to group related subfields in an organized fashion. The
new T extension fields and subfields are defined in the following files, as part
of the [CLDR 21.0.2
release](http://cldr.unicode.org/index/downloads/cldr-21-0-2):

*   i0 - Input Method Transformations:
    [bcp47/transform_ime.xml](http://unicode.org/repos/cldr/tags/release-21-0-2/common/bcp47/transform_ime.xml)
*   k0 - Keyboard Transformations:
    [bcp47/transform_keyboard.xml](http://unicode.org/repos/cldr/tags/release-21-0-2/common/bcp47/transform_keyboard.xml)
*   t0 - Machine Translations:
    [bcp47/transform_mt.xml](http://unicode.org/repos/cldr/tags/release-21-0-2/common/bcp47/transform_mt.xml)
*   x0 - Private Use fields:
    [bcp47/transform_private_use.xml](http://unicode.org/repos/cldr/tags/release-21-0-2/common/bcp47/transform_private_use.xml)

For example:

*   "zh-t-i0-pinyin", to indicate Chinese text generated with a pinyin input
    method
*   "en-t-k0-dvorak", to identify a Dvorak keyboard for English
*   "it-t-k0-osx-extended", to request an extended Mac keyboard for Italian

The private use subfields can be used for private agreements, such as:

*   "ru-t-en-x0-mobile", to indicate a translation from English to Russian for
    use on a mobile device, or
*   "ja-t-de-t0-und-x0-medical", to identify a machine translation from German
    to Japanese with a specialized dictionary for medical terms.
