Unicode CLDR 2.0 contains data for 200 languages and 183 territories: 618
locales in all. In this release, there was a concerted effort to flesh out
modern coverage-level data for the top 55 languages, for an increase of over 45%
more data fields in those languages. Overall, there was an increase of over 20%
in the total number of data fields.

## ****Features****

*   Modified coverage levels to be data-driven, and fine-tuned the allocation
*   Added special indexing characters to CJK collations for stable index buckets
    (with radical, stroke-count, or pinyin)
*   Separated locales that are insufficiently fleshed out into /seed/ directory
    (available in the repository, but not the release)
*   Added explicit parent locales, to:
    *   prevent cross-script inheritance (such as no longer inheriting
        Simplified Chinese values in Traditional Chinese)
    *   add es-419 (Latin American Spanish) as a parent for Latin American
        locales, and pt_PT for African pt locales.
*   Added fallbackRegionFormat for improved timezone names
*   Added localeKeyTypePattern and variant script names (for Hans/Hant) for
    improved locale names
*   Plurals (see also [Plural
    Rules](http://unicode.org/repos/cldr-tmp/trunk/diff/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html))
    *   Added explicit count values of 0 and 1 for plural data
    *   Enhanced plural rules to allow for explicit lists, such as "n in
        1,3,5..14"
*   Added to the Key/Type Definitions
    *   calendar type "iso8601" for ISO dates
    *   number type "tamldec" for decimal Tamil numbers
*   Restricted the use of the <alias> element to only two circumstances: in
    root, and as whole-locale aliases
*   Currency
    *   Restricted currency signs in root to only very broadly recognized
        symbols
    *   Made U+20B9 INDIAN RUPEE SIGN the default symbol for INR in root
*   Added data for relative times (such as "3 days ago") with plural support
*   Deprecated and removed references in /common/main/

    buckets (with radical, stroke-count, or pinyin)
