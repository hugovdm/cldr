# CLDR v26 BETA test announcement

The Unicode CLDR Technical Committee is pleased to announce the opening of the
CLDR Survey Tool for beta testing for Version 26 of CLDR, on May 1, 2014. CLDR
provides key building blocks for software to support the world's languages.
The beta test will give CLDR contributors a chance to try out the new features
of the tool, without having to worry about the potential impacts on CLDR itself.
If all seems to be going well during the beta test period, we plan to open the
survey tool for "official" data submission on or about Thursday, May 8.
We plan to allow data submission until June 19, and data vetting until July 3.
Version 26 is scheduled to be released in September 2014.
Highlights for the CLDR 26 release:
- Microsoft has agreed to join the CLDR project as a major contributing partner.
- The survey tool user interface has undergone a major overhaul, thanks to the
hard work of our friends at Apple. Hopefully, users will find the interface more
intuitive and easier to navigate.
- Google and IBM have also contributed significantly, especially in the area of
improving performance. We have also upgraded our hardware, so we are hoping for
less down-time and fewer interruptions to your work.
- Many new types of fields and structure, including many additional types of
units.
- The first version to support the new characters in the Unicode encoding
standard, Version 7.0, due for release in July, 2014.
