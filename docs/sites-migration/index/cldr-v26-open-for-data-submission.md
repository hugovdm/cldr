# CLDR v26 Open for Data Submission

The Unicode CLDR Technical Committee is pleased to announce the opening of the
CLDR Survey Tool for data submission for Version 26 of
[CLDR](http://cldr.unicode.org/#TOC-What-is-CLDR-) , on May 13, 2014.

We plan to allow data submission until June 19, and vetting of the submitted
data until July 3. Version 26 is scheduled to be released in September 2014.

CLDR provides key building blocks for software to support the world's languages,
and is used by much of the world’s software (see
[CLDR](http://cldr.unicode.org/#TOC-What-is-CLDR-)). Highlights for the CLDR 26
release are:

    Microsoft has joined the CLDR project as a major contributing partner.

    The survey tool user interface has undergone a major overhaul, thanks to the
    hard work of our friends at Apple.

    Google and IBM have focused on performance of the software, and we’ve also
    upgraded our hardware.

    New types of fields and structure are added, including many additional types
    of units. See [new features in Version
    26](http://cldr.unicode.org/index/downloads/cldr-26#TOC-New-Features)​.

    The new characters in the Unicode encoding standard (Version 7.0, due for
    release in July, 2014) are supported.

The CLDR survey tool can be reached by going to [CLDR Survey
Tool](http://st.unicode.org/cldr-apps/survey). To view known issues in the
survey tool, see [Known
Issues](http://cldr.unicode.org/index/survey-tool/known-bugs).

For example, we are still putting some finishing touches on some of the survey
tool documentation.

Anyone is welcome to try out the tool, although only those with accounts will be
able to make changes. To get an account, or if you have forgotten your login ID
or password, please contact your CLDR TC representative. If you don't belong to
a Unicode member organization, and are a native speaker of a language other than
American English, you can [obtain a guest
account](http://cldr.unicode.org/index/survey-tool/accounts).

Any bugs with the tool can be reported to the CLDR committee by opening a [New
CLDR Ticket](http://unicode.org/cldr/trac/newticket).

Thanks in advance for your participation in the Unicode CLDR project!
