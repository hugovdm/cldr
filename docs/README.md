**This master branch will be force-pushed regularly.**

This is a hacked-up master branch for the sake of migrating from
http://cldr.unicode.org/ to MarkDown files on GitHub, in a manner potentially
servable from GitHub Pages. (Currently GH Pages breakage is caused by Jekyll
trying to interpret what isn't its to interpret.)

- See sites-migration/index/index.md for the "front page"
- See https://github.com/hugovdm/cldr/commits/master for the commits to this
  branch.
